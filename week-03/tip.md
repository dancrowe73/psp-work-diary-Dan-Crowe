This week my group started off by having a meeting for 15 minutes at 6pm. In this we discussed what we were going to do for the week and what we had done in the previous week. 
In the Wednesday IT session we were proposed with a zombie task, this is what me and my group produced:

We had another meeting at 11am on Saturday to discuss our progress.
I then researched 35 different areas climate in the UK.
