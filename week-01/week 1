I ended up doing the team-role-preference test about three times.
Once when it came out on the teams, once in the IT session and finally before writing this and I got the same things every time. 
The main two were the facilitator and the researcher. I am quite an extoverted person so I will be most likely at the centre of discussions in the team meetings.
I will also be keen to get on with the developmemt of the programs, I am looking forward to getting down to the finer details.
