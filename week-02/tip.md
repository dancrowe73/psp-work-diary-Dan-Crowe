# Week 2

In week 2, my group worked on the recipe book, Harrun invited everyone to the repo once he created it. We all worked through it, working on building the foundations for our communications as a group. The link to the repi is below:

My team agreed on some stuff before we started. We agreed to use next.js and node.js. We also agreed on two standing meetup times, one at 6pm on a Monday which is online, and one at 11:45am on a Wednesday which is in person. This helps us keep eachother in the loop with what has been done and what needs to be done. 

We looked over the question we made in week one and carried on the preperation to sprint week. This week I also started the research for this project.
